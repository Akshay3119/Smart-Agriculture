# Smart-Agriculture
### Motivation:
 Pesticide sales alone account for over $400 million in annual control expenses and some bugs develops resistance to more than a hundred chemical compounds, making them most resilient arthropods. Plant diseases can be detected automatically using Image processing techniques, reducing the amount of surveillance needed on large plant farms and allowing for proper response in the early stages, such as when symptoms appear on plant leaves.<br>
Detecting the symptoms in a timely manner can help evaluate the seriousness of the disease and in turn help in choosing the best approach in dealing with the disease.
